COURSE SCHEDULE


All Temple University Academic Policies (Links to an external site.) will be upheld.

The Information Science & Technology, M.S. website (Links to an external site.) details program expectations.

Course Minimum Grade
Although D- is a passing grade, a minimum grade of C- is required in all courses to complete the program.

For more information, please see Temple University's Academic Policies on Grades and Grading.

Incomplete
A student will be eligible for a grade of “Incomplete” only if he/she: 1) has completed at least 51% of the work at a passing level, 2) is unable to complete the work for a serious reason beyond his or her control, and 3) files a signed agreement with the instructor outlining the work to be completed and the time frame in which that work will be completed. The student is responsible for initiating this process and all incomplete forms must be sent to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs prior to the start of study days in that semester.  

Please refer to the following for further details: Temple University’s Incomplete Policy (Links to an external site.) (Policy #02.10.13). 

Withdraw from the Course
If a student wishes to withdraw from a course, it is the student’s responsibility to meet the deadline for the last day to withdraw from the current semester

See Temple University's Academic Calendar (Links to an external site.) for withdrawing deadlines and consult the University policy on withdrawals (Links to an external site.) (Policy # 02.10.14). 

Statement on Academic Rights & Responsibilities
Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The University has a policy on Student and Faculty Academic Rights and Responsibilities (Links to an external site.) (Policy #03.70.02).

Academic Honesty
According to the University Student Code of Conduct, students must not commit, attempt to commit, aid, encourage, facilitate, or solicit the commission of academic dishonesty and impropriety including plagiarism, academic cheating, and selling lecture notes or other information provided by an instructor without the instructor’s authorization. Violations may result in failing the assignment and/or failing the course, and/or other sanctions as enumerated in the University Code of Conduct (Links to an external site.).

Netiquette
Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual.

Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's nondiscrimination statement (Links to an external site.), will add richness to this learning experience. Please consider that sarcasm and humor can be misconstrued in online interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course atmosphere.

Disability Disclosure Statement
Any student who has a need for accommodation based on the impact of a documented disability should contact Disability Resources and Services (DRS), Ritter Annex 100, (215) 204-1280 or 215-204-1786 (TTY) or drs@temple.edu, to make arrangements. Students requesting accommodations should meet with the instructor as soon as possible after the start of classes to discuss their needs and to provide documentation from DRS. Accommodations are not retroactive.
